# Home-Automation-Using-IOT

This project is based on Internet of things, in this project, I had used ESP8266 (wifi Module) with an Arduino Microcontroller which controls the Home Appliances like lights, fan, tv, ac etc, using a smart Phone via Internet.
WORKING
 I had used Arduino IDE for Programming the wifi Module, to Switch on and off the appliances, I used an Adafruit Cloud and Blink APP for Android for Controlling the Home Appliances
And also I configured Ok Google with my Device so,clients can access through their appliances through their Google Assistant, I configured Google assistant through IFFF application
